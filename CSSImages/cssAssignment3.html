        <p> I would like to go to these places because they look amazing. It would also be my dream to to
      travel to a differnt plannet. Who wouldn't want to go to another planet? There is a big chance that
      there is lifeforms on titian and that it would be inhabital by humans. Also, who wouldn't want to live
      in a Star Wars universe? I wouldn't buy any death sticks though. On a more realistic note, The Northern
      Lights would be fantastic to see. Bora Bora looks amazing and I think that I would have a great time
      there with my family. I would play at the beach and swim with my family. I would also fish with my
      brothers and dad. At the northren lights we would try to camp out a night under them while my mom and
      little brother most likely stayed in a cabin or hotel. I wonder what type of political parties they have
      on Coruscant? And would specieism be replaced with racism? At knowhere I would take a stroll through the
      collector's shop, but I doubt I would have enough credits to buy any thing. On titan I wonder who will be
      in our block and how big the colony would be. I also wonder about how the acceleration due to gravity is.
      How big would our colony be? Only time will tell.</p>
