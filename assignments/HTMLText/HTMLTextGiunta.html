    <h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>

    <h4>(Let's learn HTML!)</h4>

    <p>Before we get started let me tell you a little about myself.
    This is the first<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course.
    I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace until now.
    Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both wisdom and grace but that
    will require effort and attention to what is happening in the world and
    in myself. I hope you learn alot about web programming and are enlightened
    by what we do in the class. Good Luck! </p>

    <p>When writting webpages you need to make sure that you are attentive to
    lots of details like structure and formatting of the page. I want to <strong><em>emphasize</em></strong>
    to you the importance of this.
    <hr />

    I want to make sure you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
    <blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writting
    web pages. Afteral, small details can make a big difference. Be conscious of what
    you are learing and why you are learing it. We will certainly learn a lot in this
    class but we must always exert effort to learn.</blockquote>
