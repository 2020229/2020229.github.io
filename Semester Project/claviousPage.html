          <p id="colLef2">SLUH's Robotics Club has partnered with selected Catholic
            middle schools in the city and surrounding underserved areas to offer
            robotics training in the STEM subject areas. In addition to providing
            Lego Mindstorm EV3 robot kits and software, the school's outreach
            robotics program incorporates an initial workshop for using the kits and
            the programming software, followed by four to six sessions to assist staff
            and students in successfully developing the robotics curriculum and after-school
            activity at each middle school.</p>

            <p id="colRig2">The Clavius Project at St. Louis University High trains,
              mentors and inspires urban middle school students in STEM-related areas
              (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), thus addressing a
              critical need of the community that lacks competently trained professionals
              in these key disciplines, particularly in underserved areas of the city.</p>

              <p id="colCen2"> I love the Clavious project because I get the oportunity to
                meet so many bright, young kids from very diverse backgrounds. Seeing the
                kids smiles brightens my day every time I get to see them.
