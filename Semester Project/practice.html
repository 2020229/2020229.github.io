        <p class="daThermoCoup">A thermocouple is an electrical device consisting of two dissimilar
          electrical conductors forming electrical junctions at differing
          temperatures. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage
          as a result of the thermoelectric effect, and this voltage can be
          interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are a widely used
          type of temperature sensor.</p>

        <p class="daThermoElecEffect">he thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature
          differences to electric voltage and vice versa via a thermocouple.
          A thermoelectric device creates voltage when there is a different
          temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to
          it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a
          temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature
          gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the
          hot side to the cold side.</p>
