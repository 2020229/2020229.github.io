        <p class="val"><em><b>The Cascade Volcanoes (also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the Cascade Arc)
          are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic arc in western North America, extending
          from southwestern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California,
          a distance of well over 700 miles (1,100 km).The arc has formed due to subduction
          along the Cascadia subduction zone. Although taking its name from the Cascade Range,
          this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Cascade
          Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains, past the Fraser River which is
          the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper.</b></em></p>
